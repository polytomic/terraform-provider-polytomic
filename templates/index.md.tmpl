# Polytomic Provider

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and
datasources.

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

## Example Usage

### API Key

```terraform
provider "polytomic" {
  api_key     = "<value from settings page>"
}
```

### Partner Key

[Partner keys](https://apidocs.polytomic.com/guides/obtaining-api-keys#partner-keys) allow access to user and organization resources.

```terraform
provider "polytomic" {
  partner_key = "<value from settings page>"
  organization_user = "terraform@polytomic.com"
}
```

The `organization_user` may be any valid email address. When using a partner key
to access resources in an organization the user with this email address will be
used. The user will be created in the organization if it does not exist.

### Deployment API Key (On-Premises only)

```terraform
provider "polytomic" {
  deployment_url     = "polytomic.acmeinc.com"
  deployment_api_key = "<value from deployment environment>"
}
```

## Importing existing resources

Polytomic offers the ability to import existing resources from your Polytomic
account into your Terraform state. This allows you to manage existing resources
via Terraform.

### Running the importer

The importer is a separate binary that can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/polytomic/terraform-provider-polytomic/releases). The following command will run the importer and import all resources into the specified directory.

```bash
./polytomic-importer run --api-key $POLYTOMIC_API_KEY --output $OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```
