## Importing existing resources
Polytomic offers the ability to import existing resources from your Polytomic account into your Terraform state. This allows you to manage existing resources via Terraform. 

### Running the importer
The importer is a separate binary that can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/polytomic/terraform-provider-polytomic/releases). The following command will run the importer and import all resources into the specified directory.

```bash
./polytomic-importer run --api-key $POLYTOMIC_API_KEY --output $OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```
